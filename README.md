# Python Jumpstart
Python Jumpstart is a Python Project-based course courtesy of Michael Kennedy via https://github.com/mikeckennedy/python-jumpstart-course-demos

There are 10 applications in total, ranging from a basic date calculator to a full-fledged Real estate analyzer.

I will be adding applications as I work through the course.
